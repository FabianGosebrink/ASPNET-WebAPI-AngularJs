# AngularJs DemoApp

Demo Application for AngularJS

A simple demo application with AngularJS.

Here bower and npm is used. Run run the corresponsing commands to install/update the packages.

I also added gulp to inject the angular app and bower javascript files into the index.html.
please run "gulp injectJsIntoIndex" to inject all the files automatically.

Note that this is just a sample! NEVER use a Singleton to replace a database in a business-application.
This was just made for demo purposes.

If you have VS 2013 you can install the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8e1b4368-4afb-467a-bc13-9650572db708">Task Runner Explorer</a>, which is included in VS 2015
