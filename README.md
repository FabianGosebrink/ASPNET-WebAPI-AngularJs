# AngularJs DemoApp

Demo Application for AngularJS

A simple demo application with AngularJS.

Here bower is used. Run run the corresponsing commands to install/update the packages.

I also added gulp to uglify, minify and inject the angular app javascript files into the index.html.
You can either run the gulp default task with "gulp" or uncomment all the single javascript files. Then they are loaded explicitly.

Note that this is just a sample! NEVER use a Singleton to replace a database in a business-application.
This was just made for demo purposes.

If you have VS 2013 you can install the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8e1b4368-4afb-467a-bc13-9650572db708">Task Runner Explorer</a>, which is included in VS 2015
